# Arc forests for Thompson's group $F$

## About the project

*Thompson's group* $F$ is an object studied in mathematics, especially in group theory, which is a branch of abstract algebra.
A more detailed introduction is included in the project pages. You may well also want to read about Thompson's groups in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups).

The aim of this project is to give a new approach to visualize the elements of the group $F$ as what we called *arc forest diagrams*. These diagrams are a convenient illustration of how the standard generators of $F$ (from a finite presentation) act on $F$ from the right. Our approach is a slight modification of those found in papers of J. Belk, V. Guba and M. Sapir.
